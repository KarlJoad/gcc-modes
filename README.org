#+TITLE: gcc-modes

A collection of tree-sitter-powered Emacs major-modes for GCC's internal file formats.
This includes:
  * Machine Description files (~.md~)
  * RTL dumps
  * GIMPLE dumps
  * ~match.pd~ pattern files

This takes inspiration from [[https://github.com/RegAlloc/gcc-syntax-highlighting][gcc-syntax-highlighting]] for VSCode/VSCodium.

* Dependencies
  * Emacs >=29.1
    We use Emacs' built-in treesit library for tree-sitter support, which requires Emacs 29.1 or later.
